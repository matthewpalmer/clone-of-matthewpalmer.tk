Just a back up of my site.  
Has nice use of:  
- Dribbble API  
- Instagram RSS  
- Twitter API  
    
*(I think it's API, but it probably isn't)*  

Loads of unnecessary files... maybe it'll help you get an understanding of my work flow? Either way, it's backed up now.  
##Uses AnchorCMS... You should check it out. It's pretty awesome
Wow I'm bad at this markdown stuff.
